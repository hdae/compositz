// Why it lives here too: `list_instance_rows` returns rows already joined with an
// engine snapshot at fetch time, but the live `subscribe_instances` stream pushes
// only RAW container statuses (no `installed_tags`). So the client keeps the base
// rows and re-derives `running` / `services` from each snapshot, exactly as core
// would — one shared derivation shape, expressed twice against the same typed
// contract. See view.rs:`instance_services` / `to_instance_rows` for the source.
