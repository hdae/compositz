# Decision log

ADR-style. Each entry: status, the decision, why, and consequences. Newest concerns last.

---

## ADR-001 — One container per app; no Compose · ✅ Accepted

Each app is a single container. Multiple daemons inside one app use **s6-overlay v3**, not Docker
Compose.

**Why:** WSL-Containers / Podman compose support is unreliable; a single container is the portable
unit. s6-overlay gives real PID1, zombie reaping, and service dependencies.

**Consequences:** recipes describe one container. Multi-process apps ship an s6 service tree.

---

## ADR-002 — Hand-rolled Engine API client over a transport abstraction · ✅ Accepted (verified)

A minimal Docker Engine HTTP client on a `DuplexConn` seam: unix socket (Linux), `node:net` named
pipe (Windows), TCP fallback. Not `dockerode`.

**Why:** Windows named pipes aren't supported by `Deno.connect` but are by `node:net` (Deno ≥
2.6.2). A thin client keeps the dependency surface small and the transport swappable (future WSL
Containers / Podman). Target Engine API ≥ 1.43.

**Consequences:** we own HTTP framing (chunked / length / close), the 8-byte log demux, and the
classic build-stream parser. All verified against a live engine.

---

## ADR-003 — The manager is trusted; isolation is at the container boundary · ✅ Accepted

The CLI / server / desktop run with broad permissions (`-A`). Security is enforced by putting _apps_
in containers, not by sandboxing the manager.

**Why:** the manager legitimately needs Docker, filesystem, and network access. On Windows the npipe
transport in fact requires `--allow-all`. Pinokio's problem is uncontainerized _apps_, not manager
privilege.

**Consequences:** acceptable to run `-A`. Document it; don't pretend the manager is sandboxed.

---

## ADR-004 — GPU default-on, tri-state · ✅ Accepted

`gpu: required | preferred | none` in the manifest; default `preferred`. `preferred` tries a GPU and
falls back to CPU.

**Why:** local-AI apps usually want a GPU; opt-out is the right default. Tri-state covers the "nice
to have" middle.

**Consequences:** `--gpus all` shape is `{Driver:"", Count:-1, Capabilities:[["gpu"]]}`. CDI variant
available for Linux. nvidia-vs-CDI auto-detection is Phase 3.

---

## ADR-005 — Manifest = YAML authored, **Zod** validated (single source) · ✅ Accepted

`compositz.yaml` is authored in YAML and validated by a Zod schema that is the single source of
truth for the runtime validator, the inferred TS types, and the generated JSON Schema
(`z.toJSONSchema` → `spec/compositz.schema.json` via `deno task schema`).

**Why:** the user's prior approach (hand-written validator + separately-maintained JSON Schema)
meant two-source drift. Zod 4's `toJSONSchema` collapses them. Strict objects reject unknown keys
(catches typos in LLM-authored manifests). Zod bundles cleanly into `deno desktop`.

**Consequences:** `npm:zod` is a dependency. Manifest is versioned (`manifestVersion`).

---

## ADR-006 — uv runtime model: hardlink + co-located cache/venv + startup sync · ✅ Accepted

Resolve Python deps at container startup (`uv sync --frozen`), `UV_LINK_MODE=hardlink`, uv cache and
per-app venvs co-located on one persistent volume.

**Why (verified):** Astral discourages symlink mode (`uv cache clean` breaks installs). Hardlink +
co-location dedups wheels across apps and survives cache cleaning via inode refcounts. Plain
`uv sync` does not repair dangling links, so symlink self-heal is a myth; hardlink avoids the
problem. See the `compositz-uv-model` design note.

**Consequences:** Compositz provides `repair` / `rebuild` / `gc --reclaim` wrappers (uv has no
venv-aware GC or verify command).

---

## ADR-007 — Desktop = Deno Desktop; CEF backend for now · ✅ Accepted (interim)

The desktop app is Deno Desktop. We build with the **CEF backend** today, not the default system
WebView2.

**Why (verified):** the default WebView2/laufey backend crashes on window creation (`0xC0000409`) —
a laufey 0.4.0 ↔ WebView2 149 skew, fixed upstream in
[denoland/deno#35566](https://github.com/denoland/deno/pull/35566) — merged 2026-06-27 but **not in
the released 2.9.0**; no 2.9.1/2.9.2 exists yet (canary-only as of 2026-06-28), so the earlier
"expected 2.9.1/2.9.2" is an unconfirmed guess. This does not affect us: `--backend cef` bundles its
own Chromium (~440 MB), bypasses WebView2 entirely, and renders the container UI on **stable 2.9.0**
(machine-verified). Core's npipe transport works inside the desktop runtime (and `node:net`
named-pipe connect is confirmed implemented since 2.6.2 — deno#28332 closed 2025-12-19); build-time
`-A` is baked in.

**Consequences:** ship CEF for now; **revisit the lightweight WebView2 backend** once the fix lands
(Phase 4). `deno task desktop` builds CEF; `deno task desktop:webview` builds the (currently broken)
system-webview variant for re-testing.

## ADR-008 — UI framework: Fresh 2 (Vite) · ✅ Accepted

`packages/ui` is built with **Fresh 2 on the Vite path** (`@fresh/plugin-vite`, Fresh's default;
`--builder` is the non-Vite opt-out).

**Why:** all three candidates (TanStack Start, Fresh, SvelteKit) were empirically spiked on Deno
2.9.0 (isolated scratch dirs, project-local `bin/deno`). The decisive criterion — a server route
handler imports the real `@compositz/core` (→ `node:net` / `Deno.connect` / jsr `@std/*`), bundles
**server-only**, the client stays clean, and `deno desktop` packages it — **passed for all three**,
so the choice turned on Deno-nativeness vs ecosystem familiarity, not raw feasibility. Fresh won on:

- **Least toolchain friction**: `@fresh/plugin-vite` resolves the jsr / import-map deps natively —
  no `@deno/vite-plugin` bridge that both Start and SvelteKit required.
- **Cleanest `deno desktop`**: detected out of the box and consumes `_fresh/` directly with no
  output-path shim (Start needs a `.output/server/index.mjs` re-export; SvelteKit needs a
  `svelte.config.js` to be detected at all), and the lightest bundle (73 MB vs 228 / 107 MB
  node_modules).
- **Deno alignment**: Fresh is Deno's own framework (powers deno.com), the best odds of tracking
  future `deno desktop` / Deno changes. The islands model makes the server/client boundary
  structural, and `fresh:check-imports` **fails the build** when `node:*` reaches client code
  (verified by fault injection — the mirror of Start's Import Protection and SvelteKit's
  `$lib/server`).
- The user is Preact-experienced; Vite is Fresh 2's default/recommended path.

**Consequences:**

- `packages/ui` = Fresh 2 (Vite), a workspace member. Engine calls live in **route handlers**
  (server-only) and **never** in islands / client code. `@compositz/core` is imported by its
  workspace name.
- `packages/server` (Hono) is **retained** as a standalone headless API (`compositz serve`); its
  conditional removal from the UI data path is deferred, not decided here.
- `deno desktop` is **experimental** in Deno 2.9.0 — pin the toolchain and re-verify on upgrades.
- One residual to confirm on the first real build: workspace-name resolution of `@compositz/core` in
  Fresh's Vite SSR (the spike used a file-path import-map entry as a faithful proxy).
- `deno desktop` needs Deno ≥ 2.9; the devbox Deno here caps at 2.8.3, so a project-local `bin/deno`
  is used — see [ADR-011](#adr-011--project-local-deno-29-binary-bindeno--accepted).

## ADR-009 — Classic builder via `POST /build` · ✅ Accepted (verified)

Build images with the plain Engine API `POST /build` (classic builder), parsing the `{stream}` /
`{aux.ID}` stream.

**Why (verified):** plain `POST /build` returns the classic stream even with `DOCKER_BUILDKIT`
default — confirmed on the dev machine. Simpler than wiring a BuildKit session. Optional BuildKit is
a Phase 3 nicety.

---

## ADR-010 — Centralize the (tentative) name · ✅ Accepted

`compositz` is a working title. Project name, manifest filename, label namespace, and image
namespace live only in `packages/core/src/brand.ts`.

**Why:** the name will likely change; a rename must be a one-file edit, not a repo-wide grep.

---

## ADR-011 — Project-local Deno 2.9 binary (`bin/deno`) · ✅ Accepted

`deno desktop` is a Deno 2.9 feature, but this dev box's devbox-global Deno caps at **2.8.3**. We
keep an official Deno **2.9.0** linux-x64 binary at `bin/deno` (SHA256-verified, **gitignored**) and
invoke it by absolute path for any 2.9 feature (`deno desktop`, the `packages/ui` build). The PATH
Deno (2.8.3) stays fine for everything else.

**Why:** unblock the desktop / UI work locally without waiting on devbox to ship ≥ 2.9.

**Consequences:** temporary — once the environment provides Deno ≥ 2.9, drop `bin/deno` and its
`.gitignore` entry. CI must pin Deno ≥ 2.9 independently.
